# MPrep

## Background & Overview

- The purpose of my project is to create a simple interface that will help users plan out
their meal preps. 
  1. The current popular ways to help meal prep is to use a phone app
    and scan every single item and have the user manually choose the item through 
    a giant list of items
  2. This solution is slow and very tedious, which causes users to be discouraged 
    to meal prep
